The scope of the project is to create a movie ticket booking system that can be used by customers to book movie tickets online. The system should have a login module for user authentication. Customers should be able to select the movie of their choice, pick a date and time, select seats, and pay for the tickets online. The system should also provide a feature for customers to cancel their bookings if they are unable to attend the movie. The admin module should enable system administration, allowing the admin to manage the list of movies, showtimes, and seats available for booking.
